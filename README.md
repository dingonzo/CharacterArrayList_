# Dynamic_Array
Testing & Validation
This repository includes a dedicated test suite.
* **Memory Safety:** Verified the "Big Three" (Destructor, Copy Constructor, Assignment Operator) for deep copy integrity.
* **Edge Cases:** Tested operations on empty lists, single-element arrays, and index-out-of-bounds.
* **Dynamic Growth:** Validated `ensureCapacity()` during high-volume data insertion.
* **Functional Integrity:** Confirmed `insertInOrder` and `concatenate` maintain correct data positioning.
